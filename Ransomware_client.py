"""
Description: This script encrypts the target file with a newly generated symmetric key (SK).
To make sure this new key can't just decrypt the target file - the key is itself in encrypted using the hosts public key.
This results in the "EncryptedSymmetricKey" (ESK) - only hosts private key can get the original symmetric key back.

Once your target file is encrypted - you will be prompted to enter the secret code to decrypt your targefile again.
The code is : "ivebeenhacked"

Once this code is entered the ESK will be sent to the server (server file must be running first to handle this request). 
Server file will decrypt the ESK and send the original symmetric key (SK) back to this client script.
Next, this script will decrypt the target file.
Lastly this file will delete the ESK.

Usage: python3 Ransomeware_client.py
